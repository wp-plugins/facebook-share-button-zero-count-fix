Fixes the annoying behaviour of the Facebook share buttons not to show the counter box if something is shared less than 3 times.

== Description ==

You know it well: The Facebook share buttons with counter box can be an annoying thing for your blog design because the counter box doesn't show up for sharing count less than 3.

This plugin fixes the problem by showing a configurable count of 0 - 2 where otherwise the whole counter box would be missing and disturbing your blog layout.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin, unzip it and upload the "facebook-share-button-zero-count-fix" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
2. Activate the plugin
3. Configure the counter option
4. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Uhu, the counter number can be changed manually. Why don't this plugin allow me changing it to 13.646?  =

1. Doh. Look, at first this is a big fat lie to your readers and I don't think this is cool in any way.
2. If someone clicks your share button again, the faked number immediately disappears and shows the real count, so you're busted...
